# MarshallDataCompetition

Worked with another person in a data analytics competition where we explored a dataset given by a shipping company to figure out insightful trends that can help the company expedite shipping, especially given the supply chain issues in 2021. 
The dataset was vast with around 1,000,000 observations and 21 variables. We had 6 hours to explore, model, and present our key findings.
